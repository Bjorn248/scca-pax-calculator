## Styleguide
This project has an `.eslintrc.yml` file that defines the style standards for the project. Please use
eslint when editing to ensure that there are no style issues.
One item of note is dangling commas. We want dangling commas. This cleans up git diffs and makes
copy/pasting within the code much easier.
